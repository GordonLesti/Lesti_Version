Lesti_Version
=============

Version Control for Magento CMS

Based on https://github.com/GordonLesti/Lesti_Version - check there for License

Ideas for Improvement:
* Create a Cronjob for automated cleanup of version-table
* Load last Version on save and compare hash to only save REAL changes
* Tests

License:

* the original module can be found on http://de.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/lesti-version.html - so the license should be OSL - but Gordon Lesti didn't wrote anything regarding license - if you want to be sure - ask him.
